# lum.framework.php

## Summary

A PHP meta-package of foundational components for web apps.

This used to be a standalone collection of libraries, but as of `4.0.0`, 
all those libraries have been split off into smaller packages.

This package is no longer technically necessary, but I'll keep it around
for a while as a meta-package of common components for building web apps.

## Replacement Packages

* [lum-app](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.app.php)
* [lum-auth](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.auth.php)
* [lum-cli](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.cli.php)

Read the [Upgrade Notes](UPGRADE.md) for details on the transition.
