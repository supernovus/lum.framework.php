# lum.framework.php

## Summary

A PHP package of foundational components for web apps.

## Notice of Deprecation

This package is deprecated, and has been replaced by a more modular set of
packages instead:

* [lum-app](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.app.php)
* [lum-auth](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.auth.php)
* [lum-cli](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.cli.php)

Note that the new libraries may not have the same classes as the old one.
In order to provide a slightly easier upgrade path, I have added a transitional
package:

* [lum-framework-compat](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.framework-compat.php)

I will eventually archive this package once I've moved all my apps.

## Official URLs

This library can be found in two places:

 * [Github](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.framework.php)
