# lum.framework.php

## Summary

A PHP package of foundational components for web apps.

While the package name makes it sound like it's a full framework, it's more
like a collection of abstract classes and common traits that can be used to
write your own models and controllers.

## Major Changes Planned

Read the [PLANS](PLANS.md) for the upcoming overhaul of this package.

## More TODO

The documentation is out of date and needs a lot of work to refresh.

## Official URLs

This library can be found in two places:

 * [Github](https://github.com/supernovus/lum.framework.php)
 * [Packageist](https://packagist.org/packages/lum/lum-framework)
